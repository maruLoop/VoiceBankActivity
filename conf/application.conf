# Secret key

# The application languages
# ~~~~~
application.langs="jp"

# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.
# Default to Global in the root package.
# application.global=Global

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# application.router=my.application.Routes

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
#

db.default.url="jdbc:mysql://localhost/voicebanks_log"
db.default.user=XXXX
db.default.password=XXXX

# You can disable evolutions if needed
# evolutionplugin=disabled

# by providing an application-logger.xml file in the conf directory.

# Root logger:
